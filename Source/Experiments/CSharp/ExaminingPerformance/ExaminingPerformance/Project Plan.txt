Experiments

typeof() vs. GetType()

Conclusions:

* It doesn't matter. Both operations are very fast

Links:

* The static typeof() is faster than Object.GetType() by about 25%, but both are very fast (typeof() - 2.7s for 100M, Object.GetType() - 3.7s for 100M, relative to just static value access which is 1.1S for 100M: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/353342/performance-of-object-gettype/353435#353435
