A PLY file is an extensible file that generally contains vertices and faces, but can contain any other data elements as specified by the header.

The PLY file is split into two sections:

1. Header (always text)
2. Body (can be either text or binary).


The header is composed of:

1. The file marker ("ply").
2. The format, either "ascii", "binary_little_endian", or "binary_big_endian".
3. Comment lines (it is assumed that comments can only follow the format line, and preceed the first element line).
4. Element definitions.
5. The end of header marker "end_header".


Element definitions are composed of:

1. The element line, containing the name of the element and the number of instances of this element.
2. Property definitions.


Property definitions are composed of:

1. The data-type (one of a fixed number of values to be found at the top of the PlyFile class).
2. The name of the property.


The body is then composed of the values for each property, for each of the specified number of instances of each element.
