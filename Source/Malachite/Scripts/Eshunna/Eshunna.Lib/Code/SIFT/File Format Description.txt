The SIFT file format is composed of:

1. A header.
2. Location data.
3. Descriptor data.
4. End of file marker (0EOF);


The header is composed of:

1. SIFT file marker "SIFT".
2. Version specifier (generally "V4.0" or "V5.0").
3. Number of points.
4. Number of location data specifiers (always 5).
5. Number of descriptor components (always 128).


The location data is always composed of 5 data specifiers:

1. X as a float.
2. Y as a float.
3. Color as 4 bytes, RGBA?
4. Scale as a float.
5. Orientation as a float.


The descriptor data is composed of 128 byte components (with the entire descriptor normalized to a value of 512).

1. 128 byte-valued descriptors.
