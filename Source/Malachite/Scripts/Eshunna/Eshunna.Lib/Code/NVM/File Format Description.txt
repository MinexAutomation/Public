http://ccwu.me/vsfm/doc.html#basic (specification of the coordinate system for R, C, image center)

The NVM file format is made up of three sections:

1. The list of images (or cameras) used to compute the scene.
2. The list of 3D points in the image.
3. The list of model for which a PLY file exists.

The third section can generally be ignored.


The images (cameras) are specified by:

1. File name.
2. Focal length (assuming the same for x and y image directions).
3. A rotation matrix specified as a quaternion (4 values).
4. The location of the camera in 3D space (C = -R' * T) (3 values).
5. Radial distortion parameter (a single parameter).
6. An ending 0.


The 3D points are specified by:

1. XYX as float positions.
2. RGB as byte values.
3. A list of measurements.


A measurement is specified by:

1. Image index (as given in section 1).
2. Feature index (as given in the SIFT file for the image identified by the image index).
3. X,Y float pixel positions specified relative to the image center.
