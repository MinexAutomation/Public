The George project aims to experiment with implementing in C# functions for calculating averages, standard deviations, skew and kurtosis.

After implementing these calculators, I want to test them against an Excel file containing values. This allows working with the Excel library.
After testing versus Excel, I want to test against the Math.NET Numerics statistics functions.

These C# implementations can serve as a comparison for a C++ implementation.

An example Excel file is:

NOTES:

* Math.NET Numerics - See the Public->Common->Experiments->Jules experiment for a basic example in operating the Math.NET numerics library.
	The Math.NET Numerics statistics code calculates sample variance, sample skew, and sample excess kurtosis. It does so in an incremental, streaming way.
