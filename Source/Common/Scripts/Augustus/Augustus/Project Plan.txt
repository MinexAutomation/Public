Project Augustus

Augustus is a builder, named after the famed Roman emporer who found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble.

Augustus:
	* When provided with a list of solution file paths and make file paths, labeled with "Windows" or "Cygwin" respectively, and, if Windows, labeled with "x86" or "x64".
	* Will build each using their respective toolsets:
		* MSBuild: "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe" "C:\Path\SimpleMC1\SimpleMC1.sln" /p:Platform=x86
		* make: make --directory "C:\Path\Stats2" (after adding C:\Tools\Cygwin\bin to the PATH)
	* Direct all output from the build process to a file placed in the same directory as the solution or make file.
	* Check the output for a keyword indicating success or failure (success: "^Build succeeded.", "^Done!") otherwise failure.
	* Output list of all succeeded and failed builds.

TODO:
* Carry specification of x86 vs x64 through to the MSBuild process.
* Decide whether to allow Debug vs. Release configuration specification (though this might be a case of just using whatever the project active configuration is.)
