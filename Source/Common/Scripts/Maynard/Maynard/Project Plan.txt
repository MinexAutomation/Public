Maynard will create a binaries directory, which contains the built binaries of each tool in the Minex arsenal.

Inputs:
* A file path to a solutions list file. This is a text file containing the list of solutions which should be built and their output binaries placed into the proper spot in the binaries folder.
* An output directory path. A dated directory will be created in this path (deleted and re-written if present), as well as a current directory that is deleted and re-written each run.

Outputs:
* The binaries folder will have the following structure:

Binaries - {Date as YYYMMDD}
	Project1Name
		Project1Name.VsVersion
			Debug (Always the debug folder to aid in debugging.)
				All binaries.
	Project2Name
		Project2Name.VsVersion
			Debug (Always the debug folder to aid in debugging.)
				All binaries.
	...

Binaries - Current
	Project1Name
		Project1Name.VsVersion
			Debug (Always the debug folder to aid in debugging.)
				All binaries.
	Project2Name
		Project2Name.VsVersion
			Debug (Always the debug folder to aid in debugging.)
				All binaries.
	...


	TODO:
	* Incorporate default VS version information.
