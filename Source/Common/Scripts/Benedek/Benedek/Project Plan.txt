Benedek is a bitmap file describer.

Given the path to a bitmap file, and a path to an output text file, Benedek will provide:

* Image width and height.
* Image bits per pixel.

And other bitmap file metadata that is not really important to the main mission of reading and writing bitmaps, but is interesting from an historical perspective:

* Compression method.
* Image horizontal and verticle resolution in pixels per meter.
	(Cameras would never actually know this exact information, but maybe is set by a manufacturer to aid in printing, or was included back when bitmaps were a contender for schematic diagram representation.)
* Color table color count.
* Important color count.
