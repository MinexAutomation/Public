MATLAB - A library for interoperating with MATLAB.

Goals:
* Automate MATLAB from C# .NET code.
* Put/Get variables (strings, ints, doubles, arrays, multidimensional arrays) into/out of MATLAB.
* Run MATLAB commands as strings.
* Use MATLAB to generate figures, allow saving to an image file.

Some matlab code:

hFig = figure;
hAxes = axes('Parent', hFig);
hLine = plot(hAxes, [1, 2], [3, 4])
set(hLine, 'LineStyle', '-.')
delete(hLine)
hold on
quiver(hAxes, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0)
hold off
