Public.Common.Lib.Statistics

The statistics library provides basic implementations of common descriptive statistics:
* Mean
* Variance (sample and population)
* Skewness (sample and population)
* Kurtosis (sample excess)


Additionally, see the Public->Common->Experiment->Georges experiment for how to work with Excel statistics and the Math.NET Numerics statistics library.
