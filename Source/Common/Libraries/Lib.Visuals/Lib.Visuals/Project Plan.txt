The Public.Common.Lib.Visuals library is meant to hold classes useful in working with:
	* Color
		* Conversion, RGB to HSV.
		* Serialization
	* Windows Forms
		* Helper methods.
		* Property name constants for binding.

The namespace was named "Lib.Visuals" instead of "Code" as these features should be considered to reside in the Public common library.
The namespace was put into a separted DLL since not all applications will have a visual component.

The classes can be used to:
	* Define Windows Forms property names for use in data bindings.
	* Deserialize/Serialize colors.


NOTE: This project is based on the Minex.Common.Lib.Visuals project.
