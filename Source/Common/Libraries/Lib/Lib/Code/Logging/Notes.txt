Public.Common.Lib.Logging

The logging classes in the Public.Common.Lib library are meant to be facades for actual logging implementations of any type. Some examples might be my own, Log4Net, Serilog, NLog, etc.

These logging classes enable code to be written that is agnostic about what logging implementation will actually be used.

When a logging implemenation is selected, two classes must be written to allow its use:
1) ILogger implementation - this is the class that will actually perform logging actions. Usually this class is just a wrapper around an implementation's own logger.
2) ILoggingImplementation implementation - this is a class that provides loggers from a static context. Especially important is the construction of a default logger.
